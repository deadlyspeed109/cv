## Muhammad Hamza Mehmood

I am a 19-year-old junior full stack software developer with a passion for coding and a relentless drive to expand my horizons. Technology has always fascinated me, and I consider myself incredibly fortunate to have found my calling in the dynamic world of software development. From a young age, I've been captivated by the power of technology to solve complex problems and make the world a better place. I embarked on this incredible journey at an early age, teaching myself the fundamentals of programming and web development through online resources and hands-on projects. This self-guided learning not only gave me a solid foundation but also instilled in me a sense of curiosity and determination to keep pushing boundaries. Currently in my junior years, I am eager to gain real-world experience and work alongside seasoned professionals to learn from their expertise. My goal is to become a well-rounded and versatile full stack developer, proficient in both front-end and back-end technologies. I believe that understanding the entire development stack allows me to create seamless, intuitive, and efficient applications that resonate with users.

## Skills

Your previous experience is really important. You will need to make it really clear to someone who has not worked in your field before exactly how your experience will be useful in software development.

Consider skills relevent to software development. Then consider projects you've worked on before Makers that you feel proud of and/or you think are relevent to technology. Good examples clearly explain the impact you've had. 


Here's an example

#### Communication
I honed my communication skills while completing my thesis at university, which involved writing and defending a dissertation to a board of professors and Ph.D. candidates. I further developed these skills when I was working in a digital marketing agency where I presented quarterly business reviews to C-level stakeholders. In doing so, I synthesised complex technical information into a digestible but comprehensive story for the different levels of knowledge in the room. My communication skills have also often come in handy while training to be a developer. For example, I recently ran a session for my mentees, who have only been coding for a few weeks, on how to use mocks to improve unit test isolation. I received feedback that the session was well run and helped them understand this potentially confusing topic.

#### Another skill

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)
